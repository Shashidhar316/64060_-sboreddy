#Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify the
#various choices made in conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for 
#different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) used, the number of
#clusters formed, and so on.

#Question(C)
#Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? #(those not used in forming the clusters) 
PH <- sb_pharma[12:14] %>% mutate(Clusters=k_5$cluster)

#We can see a minor pattern in the clusters from the graphs above
#The cluster 1 has distinct Hold and Moderate Buy medians, as well as a different count from the US and Germany, but the businesses are evenly dispersed on the AMEX,NASDAQ and NYSE.
#Hold and Moderate buy medians are similarly distributed in Cluster 2
#the United States and Canada are listed on the NYSE..
#Cluster 3 has similar Moderate Buy and Sell medians, but a different count from ClusterÂ 
#France, Ireland, and the United States are all listed on the NYSE
#Cluster 4 offers Hold, Moderate Buy, Moderate Sell, and Strong Buy options.
#The median for the hold is the highest. They are from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, and they are listed in NYSE
# Cluster 5 has the same hold and mdoerate purchase medians and is spread in
#countries UK and US and is also listed in NYSE

```{r}
#Question(D)
#Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset. 
#Cluster 1 :- Buy Cluster
#Cluster 2 :- Sceptical Cluster
#Cluster 3 :- Moderate Buy Cluster
#Cluster 4 :- Hold Cluster
#Cluster 5 :- High Hold Cluster
